Welcome to my Neovim configuration crafted for Nix.
Feel free to use it as is or extract pieces to help construct your own unique setup.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repo is provided as-is and is primarily developed for my own workflows. As such, I offer no guarantees of regular updates or support. Bug fixes and feature enhancements will be implemented at my discretion, and only if they align with my personal use-cases. Feel free to fork the project and customize it to your needs, but please understand my involvement in further development will be intermittent.

## Installation Prerequisites

Before using icho, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

### System Requirements
- **Operating Systems**:
  - Linux: x86_64 and aarch64 architectures
  - macOS: x86_64 (Intel) and aarch64 (Apple Silicon)
  - Windows: Supported via WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
    - Recommended: NixOS or any modern Linux distribution
    - [WSL Installation Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
- **Nix**: Using the Nix package manager with flakes enabled
  - Nix version: 2.4 or higher (with flakes feature)
  - [Install Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html)
  - [Enable flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Enable_flakes)
  - [Nix installation on WSL](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/installation/installation)

### Nix Configuration
- Ensure your `nix.conf` has experimental features enabled:
  ```
  experimental-features = nix-command flakes
  ```

### Additional Dependencies
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- Internet connection (for initial setup and updates)

## Usage

```{nix}
{
    inputs.icho.url = "github:simonwjackson/icho";
}
```

To utilize this configuration, clone the repo and run the following command from the directory:

```
nix run
```

or remote:

```
nix run github:simonwjackson/icho
```

## Troubleshooting

Here are solutions to common issues you might encounter when using icho:

### Installation Issues

**Q: I get "error: flake 'github:simonwjackson/icho' does not exist"**
A: This usually indicates connectivity issues or GitHub being unreachable. Check your internet connection and try again. If GitHub is down, wait until service is restored.

**Q: I get "error: experimental feature 'flakes' is disabled"**
A: You need to enable the flakes feature in Nix. Add the following to your `~/.config/nix/nix.conf` file:
```
experimental-features = nix-command flakes
```
Then restart the nix-daemon or your terminal session.

**Q: The installation fails with "Unable to find package" errors**
A: This could be due to a corrupt Nix cache. Try:
```
nix-store --verify --check-contents --repair
```
Then retry the installation.

### Nix-Specific Issues

**Q: I get "warning: unknown warning: EXPERIMENTAL"**
A: This is a normal warning and can be safely ignored. It's just reminding you that you're using experimental features in Nix.

**Q: I see "cannot substitute, path is not valid" errors**
A: This is usually a permission issue. Make sure you have the appropriate permissions for the Nix store. You may need to run:
```
sudo chown -R $(whoami):nixbld /nix
```

**Q: Updates fail with "error: path ... is not valid"**
A: This can happen if your flake.lock file is corrupted. Try:
```
rm flake.lock
nix flake update
```

### Plugin Compatibility Issues

**Q: AI plugins are not working/responding**
A: AI features require external API keys to be set up. Check that you have configured the necessary environment variables. See the AI plugin documentation for specific requirements.

**Q: LSP server for my language doesn't work**
A: Some language servers require additional dependencies. Make sure the corresponding language toolchain is installed on your system outside of icho.

**Q: Plugins keep disappearing after system updates**
A: This can happen if Nix garbage collection removes dependencies. Try adding your icho flake to the nix registry to prevent garbage collection:
```
nix registry add icho github:simonwjackson/icho
```

### Performance Issues

**Q: Neovim is slow to start up**
A: This could be due to multiple factors:
- Too many plugins loading at startup - consider using lazy loading
- Large language servers initializing - configure them to start on demand
- Cold cache - subsequent starts should be faster

**Q: High CPU usage during editing**
A: This is often caused by aggressive LSP or treesitter parsing. Try:
- Disable real-time diagnostics for large files
- Add file size limits to LSP configurations
- Reduce the frequency of certain operations like linting

**Q: Memory usage grows over time**
A: Some plugins might have memory leaks. Identify the problematic plugin by starting with minimal config and adding plugins one by one to isolate the issue.

### Known Limitations

**Q: Some keybindings don't work on my system**
A: Certain key combinations might be intercepted by your OS or terminal emulator. Check for conflicts in your terminal settings or OS keyboard shortcuts.

**Q: AI-powered features give inconsistent results**
A: AI features depend on external services and can vary in quality based on model versions and internet connectivity. This is a limitation of current AI technology.

**Q: Why doesn't icho include plugin X?**
A: icho is maintained as a personal configuration. If a plugin isn't included, it's likely because it doesn't align with the maintainer's workflow. You can always fork the repository and add the plugins you need.

**Q: File-specific settings don't persist between sessions**
A: This is by design - icho prioritizes reproducible configurations via Nix, rather than session-specific settings. Use project-specific configuration files for persistent settings.
